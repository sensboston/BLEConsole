This project may not compile right out of the box. 
It depends on the Windows SDK, you can install this using "Visual Studio Installer" by clicking modify and selecting the "Windows SDK" component.

The following error indicates the Windows SDK is missing:
"Error	CS0234	The type or namespace name 'Devices' does not exist in the namespace 'Windows' (are you missing an assembly reference?)"

If you installed the Windows SDK you might need to correct the version in te path.

The following line of BLEConsole.csproj needs an update:
  <HintPath>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\UnionMetadata\10.0.16299.0\Windows.winmd</HintPath>

The path must be corrected for the development machine's Windows Kit install. In my case:
  <HintPath>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\UnionMetadata\10.0.22621.0\Windows.winmd</HintPath>
