Windows command-line tool for interacting with Bluetooth LE devices

![Screenshot](./BLEConsole/BLEConsole.png)

<!-- ## [Install via ClickOnce](https://senssoft.com/BLEConsole/BLEConsole.application) -->
This is a fork of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensboston/BLEConsole/master/BLEConsole/
to which I added/modified the **pair** and **unpair** commands.

### Requirements:

Windows 10, BT 4.0 adapter

### Console commands:

- **help**, **?**: show help information
- **quit**, **q**: quit from application
- **list**, **ls** `[w]`: show available BLE devices
- **open** <name> or <#>: connect to BLE device
- **timeout** <sec>: show/change connection timeout, default value is 3 sec
- **delay** <msec>: pause execution for a certain number of milliseconds
- **close**: disconnect from currently connected device
- **stat**, **st**: shows current BLE device status
- **print**, **p** `<text&vars>`*: prints text and variables to stdout, where are variables are:
	* `%id` : BlueTooth device ID
	* `%addr` : device BT address
	* `%mac` : device MAC address
	* `%name` : device BlueTooth name
	* `%stat` : device connection status
	* `%NOW, %now, %HH, %hh, %mm, %ss, %D, %d, %T, %t, %z` : date/time variables
- **format**, **fmt** `[data_format]`: show/change display format, can be ASCII/UTF8/Dec/Hex/Bin
- **set** `<service_name>` or `<#>`: set current service (for read/write operations)
- **read**, **r** `<name>`**: read value from specific characteristic
- **write**, **w** `<name>`** `<value>`: write value to specific characteristic
- **pair** `[<mode> [<params>]]`: pair the currently connected BLE device
   * no mode: just pair
   * mode=ProvidePin `<pin>`: pair with supplied pin
   * mode=ConfirmOnly: pair and confirm
   * mode=ConfirmPinMatch: pair and confirm that pin matches
   * mode=DisplayPin: pair and confirm that displayed pin matches
   * mode=ProvidePasswordCredential `<username> <password>`: pair with supplied username and password
- **unpair**: unpair currently connected BLE device
- **subs** `<name>`**: subscribe to value change for specific characteristic
- **unsubs** `<name>`** `[all]`: unsubscribe from value change for specific characteristic or unsubs all for all
- **wait** `<timeout>`: wait `<timeout>` seconds for notification event on value change (you must be subscribed, see above)
- **foreach** `[device_mask]`: starts devices enumerating loop
- **endfor**: end foreach loop<br/>
- **if** <cmd> <params>: start conditional block dependent on function returning w/o error
     - **elif**: another conditionals block
     - **else**: if condition == false block
- **endif**: end conditional block
	
  _* you can also use standard C language string formating characters like \\t, \\n etc._
  
  _** <name> could be "service/characteristic", or just a char name or # (for selected service)_

### Example of usage:

#### Lookup, connect and print all BLE devices names

**BLEConsole.exe < cmd.txt**, where is cmd.txt is a simple text file with content:

```
// Loop for each device
foreach 

	// Connect and if successfull
	if open $
		
		//Read first characteristic of first service
		read #0/#0
		
		// Close connection to device
		close
	endif
	
endfor
```

 - Blank/empty lines are ignored. 
 - Comments can be added by preceding them with `//`

### Below is an example of interactive use of the BLEConsole:

You can use BT name or # or address provided by **list** command. 
For example, run BLEConsole, type **ls** and it should list available BT devices, like
```
BLE: ls
#    Address           Name
#00: 85:41:35:3f:d6:8a TOZO-S2
#01: 65:b3:6e:8d:ba:f4 F2
#02: e4:98:bb:5f:80:53 LEDnetWF02004100000
```
*Note: The list consists of devices that Windows has seen in the past time. Not all devices may be available at this moment.*

Than use command **open #1** or **open TOZO-S2** or **open 85:41:35:3f:d6:8a** to connect to the device. (you can also use partial name, like TOZ if no more BLE devices with that name exist)
```
BLE: open #1
Connecting to TOZO-S2.
Found 3 services:
#00: GenericAccess
#01: GenericAttribute
#02: 2800
```

The open command will automatically list the available services on the device.
Now you can set active service and list it's characteristics, by issuing command **set #0** 
```
BLE: set #0
Selected service GenericAccess.
#00: DeviceName RW
#01: Appearance R
#02: PeripheralPreferredConnectionParameters    R
#03: 10918      R
```
Now you can read or write characteristics of the active service.

Read a characteristic by # or name, like **read #0**
```
BLE: read #0
TOZO-S2
```

Write a characteristic by # or name, like **write #0 *value***
```
BLE: write #0 123
```
If you already knew your service name/#, you can avoid previous step and read characteristic after successful  connection to BLE device, like **read #1/#0**

Data will be interpreted in the selected **format** Here we select hexadecimal as the format for both sending and receiving.
```
BLE: format hex
Current send data format: Hex
Current received data format: Hex
```

You can also directly write a value to a known service/characteristic.
For example here we write an (hexadecimal) array of data to  service (0xFFFF) / characteristic (0xFF01)
```
BLE: write 0xFFFF/0xFF01 00 04 80 00 00 0d 0e 0b 3b 23 00 00 00 00
```
